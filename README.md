# Financial-Well-Being-Analysis

## Background

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) is a United States federal agency established in 2011 that aims to ensure that people are treated fairly by financial institutions such as banks, lenders, and credit reporting bureaus.

According to the CFPB, the Financial Well-Being Survey captures measurements of individual and household characteristics that may influence adultsâ€™ financial well-being. The objective of the survey is to help policymakers, researchers, and educators understand financial challenges and design programs to improve financial literacy and stability. The survey was conducted alongside a brief questionnaire that provides a score from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating greater financial well-being. The survey data used for this analysis was obtained from consumerfinance.gov in May 2024.

## Objective
The purpose of this analysis is to answer the following questions:

1) Can the factors from one's childhood/adolescence included in the survey be collectively used to predict the survey participants' current financial well-being score?
2) Can one's interconnectedness be used to predict one's financial well-being score?
   
## Analysis

## Findings & Recommendations

## Limitations

The following limitations should be considered when reviewing this analysis:

* Personal finance survey responses are highly subjective, as individuals' responses are influenced by personal perceptions, cultural norms, and social attitudes toward money. Feelings of embarrassment or shame about financial struggles may lead to misrepresentation ultimately affecting the accuracy of the data.
* Respondents to this survey use a multiple-choice answer system, as a result they might be required to choose options that don't perfectly capture their unique situations. This limitation can lead to oversimplified data, as nuanced experiences and feelings about financial well-being may not fit neatly into predefined categories.
